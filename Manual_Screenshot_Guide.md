## üìã **SCREENSHOT CHECKLIST**

When capturing each screenshot, ensure:

- [ ] Browser window is maximized for best visibility
- [ ] All content is fully loaded before capturing
- [ ] Screenshots are saved as PNG files
- [ ] High resolution (1920x1080 or higher if possible)
- [ ] Clear visibility of all text and data
- [ ] Proper filename following the naming convention

---

## üìÇ **FILE NAMING CONVENTION**

Save screenshots with these exact names in the `screenshots/` folder:

```
screenshots/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_main_dashboard.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_dataset_info.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_model_performance.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_upload_predict.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_upload_interface.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06_eda_page.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07_eda_plots.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 08_model_management.png
```

## üí° **TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS**

### **Navigation Tips:**
- Use sidebar menu to navigate between pages
- Wait for each page to fully load before taking screenshot
- If buttons don't appear immediately, try refreshing the page

### **Dashboard Interactions:**
- **Show Dataset Info**: Look for this button in the Data Overview section
- **Show Model Metrics**: Usually found in the Model Performance section
- If buttons are not visible, scroll down to find them

### **Upload & Predict Page:**
- Make sure to capture both the file upload area and model selection
- Include any instructions or help text that appears
- Show the complete workflow interface

### **EDA Page:**
- Wait for all plots to render completely
- If plots are large, take multiple screenshots to capture all visualizations
- Include correlation matrices and statistical summaries

### **Quality Checks:**
- Verify all text is readable
- Ensure metrics and numbers are clearly visible
- Check that charts and plots are fully rendered
- Make sure UI elements are not cut off

## üéØ **WHAT TO FOCUS ON IN EACH SCREENSHOT**

### **Dashboard Screenshots Should Show:**
- Key performance metrics (Total Records, Fault Cases, Fault Rate)
- Expanded dataset preview with actual data
- Model performance statistics and metrics

### **Upload & Predict Screenshots Should Show:**
- Complete file upload interface
- Model selection options (Random Forest, LSTM)
- Prediction workflow and options

### **EDA Screenshots Should Show:**
- Data visualization plots and charts
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature analysis and statistics

### **Model Management Screenshots Should Show:**

## ‚úÖ **AFTER CAPTURING ALL SCREENSHOTS**

Once you have manually captured all screenshots and saved them in the `screenshots/` folder:

1. **Verify all 8 screenshots are present**
2. **Check that all data and metrics are clearly visible**
3. **Ensure filenames match the convention exactly**
4. **Review that each screenshot shows the intended functionality**

The screenshots will then be ready for inclusion in your academic documentation!
