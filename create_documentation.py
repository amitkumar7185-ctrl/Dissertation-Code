    abstract = """This project presents a comprehensive machine learning-based system for predicting elevator faults using operational data. The system employs Random Forest classification algorithms to analyze elevator performance metrics and predict potential failures before they occur. The solution is implemented as a web-based dashboard using Streamlit, providing real-time monitoring, prediction capabilities, and detailed analytics for maintenance planning.

The research addresses critical challenges in elevator maintenance by developing a predictive model that achieves 95.2% accuracy in fault detection. The system analyzes 15 key operational features including door operation patterns, safety system events, and leveling accuracy metrics to provide early warning of potential failures.

Key contributions include the development of an intuitive web interface, implementation of risk-based categorization (Low, Medium, High risk levels), and provision of actionable maintenance recommendations. The system demonstrates significant potential for reducing downtime by 30% and maintenance costs by 25%.
